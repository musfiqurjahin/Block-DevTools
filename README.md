<h1>Block Developer Tools</h1>
    <p>This script is designed to block users from accessing certain developer tools in the browser. The main goal is to prevent unauthorized inspection and interaction with the website's source code or debugging tools.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Disable Right-click (Context Menu):</strong> Prevents users from right-clicking on the page, which usually allows them to inspect elements or view the source code via context menu options.</li>
        <li><strong>Block F12 Key:</strong> Stops users from opening the browser's developer console using the F12 key.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable Ctrl+Shift+I and Ctrl+Shift+J:</strong> Prevents users from opening the Developer Tools (Inspect Element) and JavaScript Console using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
        <li><strong>Block Ctrl+U:</strong> Stops users from viewing the page's source code directly by pressing Ctrl+U.</li>
        <li><strong>Redirect:</strong> If any of the blocked actions are attempted, users will be redirected to a specific URL (set within the script).</li>
        <li><strong>Alert Messages:</strong> Users are notified via pop-up alerts that the action they are trying to perform is disabled.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>The script listens for certain browser events and prevents them from executing. Here's a breakdown of the behavior:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>contextmenu</code> event is intercepted, blocking the ability to open the right-click menu.</li>
        <li>Keydown events are captured to detect specific key combinations (like F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, and Ctrl+U) and prevent the associated developer tools from opening.</li>
        <li>When a blocked action is detected, the user is alerted with a message and can be redirected to a specific URL (customizable in the script).</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>To use this script on your website:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the provided JavaScript code.</li>
        <li>Paste it into the HTML file of your website within the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</li>
        <li>Customize the URL in the script where it says <code>window.location.href = "#";</code> to redirect users to a specific page when developer tools are blocked.</li>
        <li>Save the changes, and the script will automatically run when the page is loaded.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Example Code</h2>
    <p>Hereâ€™s how to implement the script:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;script&gt;
        function blockDeveloperTools() {
        document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert("Right-click is disabled for this website.");
        });
       document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
                if (e.keyCode === 123 || (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && (e.keyCode === 73 || e.keyCode === 74)) || (e.ctrlKey && e.keyCode === 85)) {
                    e.preventDefault();
                    alert("Developer tools are disabled on this website.");
                    window.location.href = "https://your-redirect-url.com"; // Customize this URL
                }
            });
        }
        blockDeveloperTools();
        &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This script is primarily used as a deterrent. It won't stop determined users from accessing developer tools but can help protect your site from casual inspection.</li>
        <li>Users with advanced knowledge can bypass this, so it should not be considered a comprehensive security measure.</li>
        <li>Always follow best practices when protecting sensitive data on your site, such as server-side security measures.</li>
    </ul>
